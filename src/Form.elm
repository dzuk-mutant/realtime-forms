# Updating forms

## Showing restricted user updates
Forms and Fields have internal values that determine
whether a user can edit certain fields, or the entire form. These functions
help you quickly check that, as well as display that information to the
user in your UI.

@docs isUpdatable, isFieldUpdatable


## Performing user input updates
In order to update and validate a user's input in realtime, the functions
that do this work need to be attached to the event handlers of the inputs
the user is using.

{-| A type that represents your whole form, including it's validation state.

See `Form.Validatable.Validatable` to understand most of this record structure,
for the things that aren't in Validatable:

- `updatesEnabled` : Boolean saying explicitly whether or not the user can edit or submit the form right now.
- `state` : A custom type (State) describing what stage of the form lifecycle the form is at.
May also dictate whether or not the user can edit or submit.
- `httpErr` : A temporary fix for now for how to display HTTP errors to the user when a form fails to be submitted.

{-| Creates a `Form` that is set up in a state which assumes
that the user hasn't filled in this particular form yet (therefore, it is `Unchecked`).

Because there are many possible representations for empty `Field`s out there,
you have to enter in what 'empty' means for the value itself.

A `Form.empty` should always contain empty Fields.

- ValidatorSet for the form itself
- A function that goes through every Field in this Form that needs validating and validates them (currently necessary boilerplate)
- The nested Fields.

{-| Creates a `Form` that is set up in a state which assumes
that the user has filled in this data point before, and therefore assumes it's already`Valid`.

Designed for forms that a user is returning to. It should contain prefilled Fields.

In addition to being `Valid`, the validation behavior is set so that validation errors are set to
show immediately.

The state of this form has been set to FormSaved (assuming that this has been saved to the server before).

{-| A type representing the different states a form can be in.

- `Unsaved` : The form (in it's current state) has not been saved.
- `Saving` : The form is being sent to the server.
User access should be disabled.
- `Saved` : The form (in it's current state) has been saved and can be entered
by the user again.
- `Done` : The form has been complete and sent, and the user should not enter
anything more and the UI should move onto something else. User access should be disabled.


It doesn't encapsulate one lifecycle, but two potentially different ones.

### One-time form
A form a user completes once and then doesn't interact with again.

1. `Unsaved`
2. `Saving` (user has clicked the submit button)
3. then either...
    - `Done` (submission successful, user cannot edit anymore, the UI moves on)
    - `Unsaved` (subumission unsuccessful, user can edit and try to submit again)


### Returning form
A form a user can keep returning to after they have saved it (like a settings form).

1. `Unsaved`
2. `Saving` (user has clicked the submit button)
3. then either...
    - `Saved` (submission successful, user can edit and submit again)
    - `Unsaved` (subumission unsuccessful, user can edit and try to submit again)

and erases the last HTTP error message (if any).

{-| Convenience function that sets the form to Done.
-}
setDone : Form b -> Form b
setDone form =
    form
    |> \_ -> { form | state = Done }





















-- validation -------------------------------------------------


{-| Validates every `Field` of a `Form`, then validates the whole `Form` itself.

-}

    in
        -- validate the whole field structure
        Validatable.validateAndToggleErr newModel



{-| Validates a field in a form value (and shows errs depending on it's behaviour).

Currently a weird stopgap to streamine fieldValidation in a Form type.
-}

                -> FieldSetter a b

-}
type alias FieldGetter a b = b -> Field a

{-| A function that sets a Field to a Form's value (`b`).
-}
type alias FieldSetter a b = b -> Field a -> b

getFieldVal accessor form =
    let
        field = accessor form.value
    in
        field.value












-- update stuff -------------------------------------------------

{-| Checks whether a form itself can be updated at all.

For instance, if a form is not updatable, you can use this function to
make it's associated submit/save button show a disabled visual state.

-}
isUpdatable : Form b -> Bool
isUpdatable form =
    form.updatesEnabled && (not <| List.member form.state [Saving, Done])

{-| Checks whether a field in a form can be updated at all.

For instance, if a field is not updatable (or the form the field is a part of),
you can use this function to make it's associated input show a disabled visual state.

{-| Internal helper designed to absorb a Field value coming from an input's
event handler and do nothing with it, only returning the already existing
form with the already existing fields that it contains.
-}
dontUpdateField : Form b -> a -> Form b
dontUpdateField form _ = form


-- event handlers -------------------------------------------------


{-| Takes an `(a -> msg)`, updates the `Field` value to that `a` and performs
validation on both the field and the form.

This is intended to be used in event handlers that return values the user
directly inputs, like `onInput` in text inputs and `onCheck` in checkboxes.

- `a` is the `Field` data type.
- `b` is the `Form` data type.

```
    Html.input
        (   [ class "ps--text-input"
            , type_ "text"
            , onInput <| Form.updateField field form setter onChange
        )

{-| This updates and validates a field, but you provide the value that it's
being updated to yourself. This is necessary for things like `onClick` in radio buttons.
